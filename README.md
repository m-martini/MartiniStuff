# MartiniStuff

A sandbox of miscellaneous things python and other items that have no other home

How I wish I had gone about learning python (may others learn from me):  https://github.com/mmartini-noaa/MartiniStuff/wiki

Some things I don't want to forget reside here.

This repository is used for learning about Git subtleties, the history may look very interesting.

Testing now.
